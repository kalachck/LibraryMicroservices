## Technologies
PostgreSQL. This is SQL database. This choice is determined by the speed and portability, then NoSQL databases.
The main advantages of PostgreSQL are open source, no licence fees, scalability and excellent security mechanism.  

EntityFrameworkCore is used as a database access technology because it provides autogenerated code, unique syntax for all object queries whether it is database or not and it is easy to map business objects

AutoMapper is a simple little library built to solve a deceptively complex problem - getting rid of code that mapped one object to another  

As for the FluentValidation tool, it will allow save time when solving problems related to data validation, bring disparate self-made checks to a single view



##### Database structure:

| Borrowing          |
| -------------------|
| Id                 |
| UserEmail          |
| BookId             |
| AddingDate         |
| ExpirationDate     |

##### Logic:
This service implements a packaging by components architecture. The Component layer is entended for acces to the storage of borrowings and service logic. The Api layer deloged for convenient display for manipulation the borrowings data
