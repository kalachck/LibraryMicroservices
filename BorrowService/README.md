## Technologies
PostgreSQL. This is SQL database. This choice is determined by the speed and portability, then NoSQL databases.
The main advantages of PostgreSQL are open source, no licence fees, scalability and excellent security mechanism.  

EntityFrameworkCore is used as a database access technology because it provides autogenerated code, unique syntax for all object queries whether it is database or not and it is easy to map business objects

Hangfire is an easy way to perform background processing in NET Core applications. No Windows Service or separate process required. Backed by persistent storage. Open and free for commercial use.

RabbitMQ is one of the most popular open source message brokers. RabbitMQ is lightweight and easy to deploy on premises and in the cloud. It supports multiple messaging protocols. RabbitMQ can be deployed in distributed and federated configurations to meet high-scale, high-availability requirements.

##### Database structure:

| Borrowing          |
| -------------------|
| Id                 |
| UserEmail          |
| BookId             |
| BookTitle          |
| AddingDate         |
| ExpirationDate     |

##### Logic:
This service implements a packaging by components architecture. The Component layer is entended for acces to the storage of borrowings and service logic. The Api layer deloged for convenient display for manipulation the borrowings data
