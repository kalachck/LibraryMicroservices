## Technologies
Microsoft SQL Server. This is SQL database. This choice is determined by the speed and portability, then NoSQL databases.
The main advantages of MS SQL Server are improved performance, security and excellent data restoration and recovery mechanism.

OpenIddict was chosen because it is a free project with good documentation and open source. 

EntityFrameworkCore is used as a database access technology because it provides autogenerated code, unique syntax for all object queries whether it is database or not and it is easy to map business objects



##### Database structure:

| Users              |
| -------------------|
| Id                 |
| Name               |
| LastName           |
| Login              |
| Password           |
| Role               |

##### Logic:

The BLL implements the user validation process for successful authorization or registration. The API Deloged for convenient display of the authorization process in the browser and management of endpoints
