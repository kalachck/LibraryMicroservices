## Technologies
Microsoft SQL Server. This is SQL database. This choice is determined by the speed and portability, then NoSQL databases.
The main advantages of MS SQL Server are improved performance, security and excellent data restoration and recovery mechanism.

EntityFrameworkCore is used as a database access technology because it provides autogenerated code, unique syntax for all object queries whether it is database or not and it is easy to map business objects

AutoMapper is a simple little library built to solve a deceptively complex problem - getting rid of code that mapped one object to another  

As for the FluentValidation tool, it will allow save time when solving problems related to data validation, bring disparate self-made checks to a single view
